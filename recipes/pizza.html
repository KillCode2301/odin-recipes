      <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>1 cup warm water</li>
      <li>1 packet active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>Your favorite toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit
        for about 10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center
        and add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes
        until smooth and elastic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and
        let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).</li>
      <li>
        Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a floured surface. Roll it out
        to your desired thickness and shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet. Spread the pizza
        sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce. Add your
        favorite toppings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is
        golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing
        and serving. Enjoy!
